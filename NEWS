  CHANGES IN Aclust VERSION 2.0.1

OVERVIEW

   o All functions default to using annotation
     for Genomic Build 37 (coordinates named 
     MAPINFO in Illumina's annotation files)
   o Minimal improvements of documentation to 
     pass R CMD check
   o included dataset and annotation were 
     trimmed to 500 sites on chromosome 7 
     to speed up runtime for examples
